# Going-Concern
README File for "Findings and Analysis Python Code"
Project Title: Findings and Analysis Python Code
Repository Link: https://github.com/rokosu/Going-Concern/edit/main/README.md

Overview
This repository contains Python code for conducting statistical and econometric analyses to examine the impact of going concern uncertainties on financial statement quality. The code includes data simulation, descriptive statistics, panel data analysis, instrumental variable (IV) regression, and generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation. The results are presented in tables and visual aids, making it easy to interpret the findings.

This project is designed for researchers, academics, and practitioners interested in financial reporting, auditing, and corporate governance. The code is fully reproducible and can be adapted for similar analyses.

Key Features
Data Simulation: Simulated financial and survey data to mimic real-world datasets.

Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics for key variables (e.g., ROA, leverage ratio, going concern disclosures).

Panel Data Analysis: Fixed effects and random effects models to analyze relationships over time.

Instrumental Variable (IV) Regression: Two-stage least squares (2SLS) to address endogeneity.

Generalized Method of Moments (GMM): Dynamic panel data analysis to account for unobserved heterogeneity.

Visual Aids: Bar charts and line graphs to illustrate key findings.

Requirements
To run the code, you will need the following Python libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Statsmodels: For statistical modeling.

Linearmodels: For panel data, IV, and GMM analysis.

Seaborn and Matplotlib: For data visualization.

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy
pip install pandas numpy statsmodels linearmodels seaborn matplotlib

How to Use
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/rokosu.git
cd rokosu
Run the Python Script:
Execute the findings_analysis.py script to generate the results:

bash
Copy
python findings_analysis.py
Review the Outputs:

Descriptive Statistics: Saved as descriptive_stats.csv.

Panel Data Results: Saved as panel_results.txt.

IV Regression Results: Saved as iv_results.txt.

GMM Estimation Results: Saved as gmm_results.txt.

Visual Aids: Saved as perception_differences.png and financial_quality_trend.png.

Customize the Code:

Modify the simulate_data() function to use your own dataset.

Adjust the variables and models in the analysis as needed.

Code Example
Below is a snippet of the main Python script (findings_analysis.py):

import numpy as np
from linearmodels import PanelOLS, IV2SLS, GMM
import statsmodels.api as sm
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        'auditor_perception': np.random.normal(4.20, 0.65, num_surveys)
    }
    return pd.DataFrame(financial_data), pd.DataFrame(survey_data)
